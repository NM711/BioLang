# BioLang

### Description

BioLang is meant to be a statically typed, high level langauge that is easy to write,
and easy to learn.

It is meant to be written procedually but also has support for object oriented features via object composition.

It is also meant to be event driven.

### The Interpreter

The Biolang interpreter, which at the moment has no real alias is crafted entirely in c++.



its end goal is for the runtime to have:

1. Stack
2. Event Loop
3. Queue

And I also plan to implement a garbage collector at some point.

A lot of the runtime design decisions I take will most likely be inspired by the V8 javascript interpreter.

Maybe its a bit too ambitious and have underestimated the time it will take to build all this but, that is the general idea
I had in mind for my interpreter.

### Sidenotes

**This language is still in early stages of development**
