1. Improve error handling within the parser, for example if the parser encounters:

   123 = 123
   
   Then we should throw a specific error "Invalid left hand side" or something similar, when assigning
   you can only use idents on the left.

2. Work on bytecode + bytecode emitter

3. Work on VM

4. Fix lexer line number issue

5. Tree nodes should contain the position of the node in the text file, this will be useful for the second pass and any errors encountered after it.
